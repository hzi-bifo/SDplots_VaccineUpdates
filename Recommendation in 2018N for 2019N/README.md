This folder contains the results for the SD plots analysis in the season 2018N.

HA sequences for the influenza subtypes H3N2 and pH1N1 were downloaded from GISAID on February 19, 2018, including all data from the beginning of the 2010S season (April 1st, 2010).
Phylogenetic trees were generated and rooted with the strain that was predominant the year before (A/Perth/16/2009 for H3N2 and A/California/05/2009 for pH1N1). SD plots were inferred and can be found [here for H3N2](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202018N%20for%202019N/H3N2_2018N.significant_positions.png) and [here for pH1N1](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202018N%20for%202019N/pH1N1_2018N.significant_positions.png).

For the recommendation of a vaccine update, only substitutions identified in the current season (i.e. 2018N) are of relevance. For H3N2, we identified T131K, R142K and R261Q as significant changes. All three changes are located in the head region of the HA protein ([structure shown here](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202018N%20for%202019N/SDplots_2018N_H3N2_structure.png)) and position 131 is a known antigenicity changing site ([details listed here](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Antigenicity%20or%20avidity%20changing%20sites.xlsx)). We therefore recommend a vaccine update for season 2019N to include a representative strain of the subclade that includes the changes T131K, R142K and R261Q.

In pH1N1, the substitution S164T was significant (in H3N2 numbering: 167). This site is not included in the [list of known antigenicity or avidity changing sites](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Antigenicity%20or%20avidity%20changing%20sites.xlsx) which we have used in the SD plots study for the evaluation. Altough this position is located in the head region of the HA protein opposite of the receptor binding site ([structure shown here](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202018N%20for%202019N/SDplots_2018N_pH1N1_structure.png)), no antigenic changes have been previously reported according to [a report for the WHO consultation meeting in the last season 2017S](https://www.crick.ac.uk/media/393884/crick_sh2017_vcm_report_to_post.pdf), when this change initially occured. We therefore do not recommend a vaccine update for season 2019N for pH1N1. 
However, it should be noted that the antigenicity and avidity changing sites that we use for the evaluation have been experimentally identified for the H3N2 subtype and don't necessarily have the same function in the pH1N1 virus. To our knowledge, there are no comprehensive studies of antigenicity or avidity altering sites in the pH1N1 virus yet, which makes the evaluation of observed sites in the SD plots difficult for this subtype and the recommendation should be taken with caution.
