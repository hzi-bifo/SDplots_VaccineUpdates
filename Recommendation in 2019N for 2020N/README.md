This folder contains the results for the SD plots analysis in the season 2019N.

HA sequences for the influenza subtypes H3N2 and pH1N1 were downloaded from GISAID on February 15, 2019, including all data from the beginning of the 2015N season (October 1st, 2014).
Phylogenetic trees were generated and rooted with the strain that was predominant the year before (A/Fujian/411/2002 for H3N2 and A/California/07/2009 for pH1N1). SD plots were inferred and can be found [here for H3N2](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202019N%20for%202020N/H3N2_2019N.significant_positions.png) and [here for pH1N1](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202019N%20for%202020N/pH1N1_2019N.significant_positions.png).

For the recommendation of a vaccine update, only substitutions identified in the current season (i.e. 2019N) are of relevance. For H3N2, we identified K92R, H311Q, N121K, R142G, E62G and Q261R as significant changes, of which only position 62 is a known antigenicity changing site ([details listed here](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Antigenicity%20or%20avidity%20changing%20sites.xlsx)). We therefore recommend a vaccine update for season 2020N to include a representative strain of the subclade that includes the changes K92R, H311Q, N121K, R142G, E62G and Q261R.

For pH1N1, no important changes were identified in 2019N. For this reason, we don't recommend a vaccine update for season 2020N.
