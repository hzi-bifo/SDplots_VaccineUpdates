This folder contains the results for the SD plots analysis in the season 2020N.

HA sequences for the influenza subtypes H3N2 and pH1N1 were downloaded from GISAID on February 10, 2020, including all data from the beginning of the 2014S season (April 1st, 2014). Phylogenetic trees were generated and rooted with a strain that was predominant previously (A/Fujian/411/2002 for H3N2 and A/California/07/2009 for pH1N1). SD plots were inferred and can be found [here for H3N2](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202020N%20for%202021N/H3N2_2020N.significant_positions.png) and [here for pH1N1](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202020N%20for%202021N/pH1N1_2020N.significant_positions.png).

For the recommendation of a vaccine update, only substitutions identified in the current season (i.e. 2020N) are of relevance. For H3N2, no significant changes were identified in 2020N. For this reason, we don't recommend a vaccine update for season 2021N.

For pH1N1, we identified D187A and Q189E as significant changes. These sites are not included in the list of known antigenicity or avidity changing sites. Therefore, we don't recommend a vaccine update.
