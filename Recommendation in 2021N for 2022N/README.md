This folder contains the results for the SD plots analysis in the season 2021N.

NOTE: Due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, only very few sequences are available for the 2021N season for both H3N2 and pH1N1. The sequences that are available further show a strong geographical bias. All results presented here should therefore be taken with caution, as they might not be representative for the whole viral population and might change in the coming months if more data is added.

HA sequences for the influenza subtypes H3N2 and pH1N1 were downloaded from GISAID on February 10, 2020, including all data from the beginning of the 2018N season (October 1st, 2018). Phylogenetic trees were generated and rooted with a strain that was predominant previously (A/Fujian/411/2002 for H3N2 and A/California/07/2009 for pH1N1). SD plots were inferred and can be found [here for H3N2](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202021N%20for%202022N/H3N2_2021N.significant_positions.png) and [here for pH1N1](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots_VaccineUpdates/blob/master/Recommendation%20in%202021N%20for%202022N/pH1N1_2021N.significant_positions.png).
